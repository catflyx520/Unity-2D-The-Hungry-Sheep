# Unity-2D-The-Hungry-Sheep
## https://catflyx520.itch.io/the-hungry-sheep  play the game with Itch.io website.<br>
### Yes, we have a trailer video: https://youtu.be/wXIoiwaZbcM<br>
The purpose of this project is to mimic a game and derive a variant or upgrade version of the game. <br>
The Hungry Sheep is done with a team of 3.  <br>
The Hungry Sheep is an almost fully complete game with main screen, end screen, music, sound effect, background images, and avartars. <br>
All music, avartars, and background images are self made by the team.<br>
Russ whose in charge creating all the music and images. Meiying and I in charge of design, coding, and testing. <br>
The game is inspired by the game Sushi Cat.<br>
The complete file is way too big, thus I only upload the C# scripts and the Unity WebGL version of Unity 2D.<br>
