## https://catflyx520.itch.io/the-hungry-sheep  play the game with Itch.io website.
Done with a team of 3. First complete game done with main screen, music, and sound effect. All background images, avartars, music are done by the team. Team consist of artist Russ whose in charge creating all the music and images. Meiying and I in charge of design and coding. 
The game is inspired by the game Sushi Cat, and it has a original version and a variant version. 
The complete file is way too big, thus I only upload the C# scripts and the Unity WebGL version of Unity 2D.
