# Unity-2D-The-Hungry-Sheep
## https://catflyx520.itch.io/the-hungry-sheep  play the game with Itch.io website.
### Yes, we have a trailer video: https://youtu.be/wXIoiwaZbcM
The purpose of this project is to mimic a game and derive a variant or upgrade version of the game.
The Hungry Sheep is done with a team of 3. 
The Hungry Sheep is an almost fully complete game with main screen, end screen, music, sound effect, background images, and avartars. 
All music, avartars, and background images are self made by the team.
Russ whose in charge creating all the music and images. Meiying and I in charge of design, coding, and testing. 
The game is inspired by the game Sushi Cat.
The complete file is way too big, thus I only upload the C# scripts and the Unity WebGL version of Unity 2D.
